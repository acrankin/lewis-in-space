           LEWIS IN SPACE</p>
      
          <p>Our furry friend was last seen fleeing the paws of the insidious Darth Journey. Lewis the Dog is now lost in the reaches of space itself.</p>
      
          <p> With fuel tanks running low, Lewis needs to make some snap decisions to make it back to his home, Planet Alchemy.</p>
      
          <p>Marty Solo and Princess Megan Organa are patiently standing by for his arrival. Countless amounts of treats and personal space are awaiting our courageous canine.</p>

          <p>It's up to Lewis and Lewis alone to make the right choices to arrive safely. As each scenario unfolds, choose the best path for Lewis and his adventure.</p>

          <p>Be careful! The Dark Side is strong in this neck of the woods. If you make too many dark decisions, who knows what'll happen!</p>
